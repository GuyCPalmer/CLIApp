##Bamazon!

The Bamazon customer can view and purchase items. 

The customer can select which item he would like to purchase from the inventory list.

The customer can select how many units of the item he would like to purchase. 

If the customer selects too many items it will prompt the customer there isnt enough product in stock and return them to the previous screen.

The inventory is tracked in mySQL.
